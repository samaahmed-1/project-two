# 🗂 Data Processing & Data Cleaning

Began with a raw sales dataset that contained various sales and customer details. The dataset was meticulously cleaned using Microsoft Excel to:

✅ Ensure data consistency across all records

✅ Remove any irrelevant or corrupt data points

✅ Standardize categorical fields (e.g., countries, categories)

✅ Aggregate data for key metrics and visualizations
